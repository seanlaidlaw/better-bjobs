# better-bjobs
a curses based wrapper script for LSF BJOBS command to improve on design and increase usefulness

## Why ?

Standard bjobs output is not interactive, is not color highlighted, and is not information dense.
better-bjobs aims to provide a wrapper to extract the useful information from bjobs and discard the rest.

The best way to understand this is to compare the outputs of both:

### Standard Bjobs Output

### Better-Bjobs Output
